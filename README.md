# learning-and-sharing
Today, I was heard a voice like this, " Code is not only for working, is more than sharing". In the last several years, this opinion had not remained in my mind yet. But I think this situation is gonna be changed from now on.  By the way, I am review the basic knowledge  these days. And I am planing to learn data structure and algorithms, Java multi-thread and Spring. I will share my code, questions, and the settlement in git. I hope that, for the first time, I can regulate my programming habits; and share my experience for the people, and it will be the best to receive your comments and some suggestions.
